SQLAlchemy 2.0 - The One-Point-Four-Ening 2021

SQLAlchemy enters the "Python 3 only" world with an all-new rethink of it's Core
and ORM APIs known as SQLAlchemy 2.0.   Right now, SQLAlchemy 2.0 is in
its transitional "caterpillar to butterfly" state, which is the new
SQLAlchemy 1.4 series, currently in beta releases.

This tutorial will be the premiere of the classic "from the ground up" tutorial
of SQLAlchemy re-imagined for the new 2.0 way of working, featuring a much
greater consistency between the "Core" and "ORM" experiences.   There will be
nary an "engine.execute()" nor a "session.query()" to be found.  New ORM
configurational patterns are presented a well.

Presented in terms of a four-layered model, which include "Engine and
Connection Basics", "Table Metadata", "SQL Expression Language", and "ORM
Usage", the tutorial is broken into two sections and API use is presented in
terms of a console runner application which participants can install locally
and follow along.
