Intro To SQLAlchemy Supporting Handout
======================================

This directory contains a set of supporting documentation first written for
this tutorial many years ago. It's a general introduction to SQL and is
agnostic of SQLAlchemy or any other Python tool.

While the reading list is kind of dated at this point, the material here can be
built with Sphinx using "make html" for HTML or "make latexpdf" for PDF, if
LaTeX tools are installed.
