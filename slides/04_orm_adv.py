# However, SQLAlchemy was designed from the start to tame the "N plus one"

# JOIN or INNER JOIN to load parent + child in one query.  joinedload() can
# work for collections as well, however it is best tailored towards many-to-one
# relationships, particularly those where the foreign key is "not null".
